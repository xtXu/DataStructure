# Introduction to Data Structure

**Data Structure:**

A way to store and organize data in a computer, so that it can be used efficiency.
1. Mathematical/logical models or Abstract data types(ADT)
2. Implementation

**Abstract data types (ADT):** define data and operations, no implementation.

*eg: List is ADT, and array is implementation.*
